# Applied-Text-Mining-in-Python
This repo contains the collections of course materials, datasets and assignments used in the Applied Text Mining in Python.  
In the first week of the course, Natural Laanguage Processing was introduced, its meaning and application in real world with the popular NLP library nltk.
The second week focused on the cleaning and manipulation of text data with regular expression library in python for use in Learning Algorithms. 
The third week entailed the application of natural language processing  methods such as tokenizations, stemming, lemmatization, parts of speech tagging to extract relevant texts, conversion of the texts to vectors with feature extraction methods, and application of the supervised learning algorithm for Sentimental Analysis. 
The final week delved into advanced usage of Natural Language Processing, Document Similarity, Topic Modelling and Distribution, Information extraction.
